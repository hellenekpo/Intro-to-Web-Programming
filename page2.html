  <li>What are your web design goals?</li>
  <p>
    I want to learn how to make websites so I can make websites for myself and also get skilled enough to have clients that I create websites for!
  </p>
  <li>Which aspects of web design interest you the most?</li>
    <p>
      Honestly, I love the creativity. There is so many different things you can do when you're creating a website, and many different aspects and visual effects that you can add on. I like how it's a great mesh between computer science and arts.
  </p>
  <li>What current skills do you have that will be useful in creating web pages?</li>
    <p>
      I have a few programming skills. I know a good amount on conditions and loops. I think this would be very beneficial to web development. I know how to code in Python and C++.
  </p>
  <li>Which skills will you need to brush up on?</li>
    <p>
      I need to brush up on HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, almost everything! I did a little coding in them for a class Spring semester of last year, but I haven't played around with them much. I would like to use this class to get me more used with using them!
  </p>
  <li>Which hardware and software tools do you already have for web design?</li>
    <p>
      Honestly, I don't have much software for web design. Unless you consider Xcode, a program that I use to code in C++. When I used to code in HTML, I used this wonderful app called Atom also, and VirtualBox!
  </p>
  <li>Which tools do you need to buy? Which tools would you like to buy eventually?</li>
    <p>
      I would like to obtain a large monitor so that I could
