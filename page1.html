      About Me!
    </h1>
    <p>
      My name is Hellen Ekpo and I'm from Houston, Texas. I am currently a sophomore at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering studying Computer Science
      I am Nigerian and proud! I enjoy eating pasta, tacos, avocados, and much more; those are just my favorite foods currently. I enjoy listening to music alot, here's a
      <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/user/xxskittles-xx?si=9GkryhcuTzyfH6Gov2XVTw">link</a> to my profile! I enjoy spending time with friends and family and having a good time
      I want to get back more into my hobbies such as playing the alto saxophone (I've been playing for 9 years now) and photography. I recently got a camera from my brother
      on my birthday, which was January 10th! 
      One of my favorite artist is Tyler, the Creator, and he recently just
      won his first Grammy ever. He also performed at the Grammy awards. Below is a video of his performance.
